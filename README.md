# NewLing - Learn New Languages with Flashcards

NewLing is a mobile application built with React Native that aims to help users learn new languages by focusing on learning the most frequent words first. The app utilizes a flashcard-style presentation to facilitate vocabulary retention and offers flexibility in displaying the content by supporting three sides for each term. This feature caters specifically to Chinese language learning, where the three sides would represent writing, translation, and pinyin for pronunciation.

## Key Features

- **Flashcard Learning**: NewLing provides a flashcard-based learning experience, which has been proven effective in aiding vocabulary acquisition.
- **Frequency-based Vocabulary**: The app focuses on teaching the most frequent words in a language first, enabling learners to grasp essential vocabulary quickly.
- **Customizable Card Sides**: Each flashcard in NewLing can have three sides, allowing users to choose which two sides to display. This flexibility accommodates various language learning needs.
- **Writing Side**: NewLing supports the inclusion of the writing side, which helps learners practice the characters or script of the target language.
- **Translation Side**: The translation side provides the meaning or equivalent of the word in the user's native language.
- **Pronunciation Side**: For Chinese language learners, NewLing offers the pinyin side, which assists with the correct pronunciation of Chinese characters.
